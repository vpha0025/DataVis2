    <h1><u>2019 Road Death in Victoria</u></h1>

                    <h2>The <span style="color:#8a72cc">fatal accident data</span> is a dataset which outlines all road death within Victoria. <br> It includes records such as <span style="color:#8a72cc">accident number, date, age and gender</span>  (just to name a few) between the years <br> 2005 and 2020.  <br> The aim of this visualisation, is to highlight the interesting features surrounding <span style="color:#8a72cc">Road death in Victoria in 2019</span></p>
                        <div id="map">
                    </div>

                           <p> There are many different factors that cause fatal road <br> accidents. One of the important factors is <span style="color:#8a72cc"><u>age</u></span>.  Depending <br> on the age group there are different components such as <br> health or even social influence, just to name a few. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="grid-item">

                            <p>Due to human nature there will always be stereotypes <br> between <span style="color:#8a72cc"><u>man</u></span> and <span style="color:#8a72cc"><u>woman</u></span>. In this case, the stereotype is <br> that <span style="color:#8a72cc"><u>men</u></span> are more reckless on the street than <span style="color:#8a72cc"><u>women</u></span> <br> This visualisation suggest that those perceptions are true.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="grid-item"> 
                        <div id="bar1"> </div> 
                            <p>The unfortunate part about roads is that anyone can be in <br> danger without being inside the vehicle. This visualisation illustrates the count of the different <span style="color:#8a72cc"><u>road user type</u></span> who <br> passed away on the road.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>This visualisation aims to portray the correlation between <span style="color:#8a72cc"><u>road death</u></span> and the <span style="color:#8a72cc"><u>time of the month</u></span>. Time matter in <br> this case due to reasons such as the weather or holidays <br> in which there might be less poeple on the road. </p>
